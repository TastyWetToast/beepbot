# uploaderbot
currently working on getlastdecal command
it uploads decals to roblox.<br/>
the command is !upload `[image]`
it does not bypass the decal and if u need it to u gotta do it urself<br/><br/>
</br>i do not suggest using your main account as anyone can access the upload command and possibly get your account terminated</br>
</br>this tool does not automaticly update itself and newer versions can often be found here!
